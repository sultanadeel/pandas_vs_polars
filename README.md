# pandas_vs_polars
Analyzing what makes polars a strong competitor to pandas when using large datasets for data mining with Python.
Performance is a critical issue when using large datasets for data analysis especially when rsources like comouting power and RAM are limited. Pandas often performs not so well with large datasets so Polars is expected to provide better performance in terms of speed, memoray usage and integration with Python ecosystem.
This course is an introduction to the strengths and limitation of Pandas vs Polars in performance critical data science operations.
